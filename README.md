### Project Title

Project 2 - Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description

This project was created to allow the user to explore bikeshare data across three major US Cities (Chicago, New York City and Washington D.C.) in the first six months of 2017. 

The project allows for an interactive experience by prompted the user to enter one of these cities, followed by the month of the year, and then the day of the week they would like to explore. Once this input is provided, a number of statistics are then calculated basedn on the trips undertaken during this period (e.g. Trip durations, Popular Stations used, User Details etc.). The project also provides an opportunity for the user to continue exploring further data once they have received the initial results.	 

### Files used
